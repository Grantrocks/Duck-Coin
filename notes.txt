P2PKH is the model of this currency
When the a user broadcasts a transaction, nodes will do the following:
take the info from the broadcase, SIG(sign Old TX Hash) and PUBKEY
Hash the public key and compare the result to the hashed pubkey inside the tx.
If they match, use the public key to verify signature and if that works then add the transaction to the
tx pool.
